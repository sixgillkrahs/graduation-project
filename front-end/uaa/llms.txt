A comprehensive React UI library for enterprise-level applications.

Core Information

Framework: React

Language: TypeScript-first

Design System: Ant Design Specification

Primary Use Case: Admin dashboards, enterprise systems, data-heavy applications

Official Docs: https://ant.design

Key Concepts (IMPORTANT FOR LLMs)
1. Form System

Form is stateful and controls child inputs.

Form.Item name can be:

string

string[] (nested object path)

Form values are retrieved via:

form.getFieldsValue()
form.validateFields()


Empty inputs usually return:

"" for Input

undefined for Select / DatePicker (after clear)

⚠️ LLMs should always clean empty values before using them as filters.

2. Controlled vs Uncontrolled

Most AntD components are controlled via Form

Avoid mixing value/onChange manually when wrapped in Form.Item

Use Form.useForm() to control lifecycle

3. Date Handling

Uses dayjs (since AntD v5)

DatePicker.RangePicker returns:

[dayjs, dayjs] | null


Dates should be normalized before sending to backend:

startOf("day")

endOf("day")

4. Common Components & Behavior
Input

Returns "" when cleared

allowClear triggers clear icon

onPressEnter is commonly used for search

Select

allowClear → value becomes undefined

onChange(value) fires on clear

Table

Controlled pagination via:

pagination={{ current, pageSize }}


onChange(pagination, filters, sorter)

Server-side sorting/filtering is common

5. Styling

Default CSS-in-JS (v5)

Supports:

CSS variables

Tailwind (with reset strategy)

Avoid overriding internal class names directly

Best Practices (LLMs SHOULD FOLLOW)

✅ Use Form.Item name={["a","b","c"]} for nested data
✅ Clean empty form values before API calls
✅ Convert date ranges before querying backend
✅ Reset page = 1 when filters change
✅ Prefer declarative Form usage

❌ Do NOT rely on raw DOM events
❌ Do NOT assume cleared input = null
❌ Do NOT mutate Form values directly

Example Patterns
Filter Form → API Query
const values = form.getFieldsValue();

const cleaned = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(values).filter(
    ([, v]) => v !== "" && v !== undefined && v !== null
  )
);

Nested Form Field
<Form.Item name={["basicInfo", "name"]}>
  <Input />
</Form.Item>


Result:

{
  basicInfo: {
    name: "John"
  }
}

Common Pitfalls

Forgetting to clean empty strings

Overwriting nested filter objects

Using string path instead of array path in Form

Not resetting pagination on filter change

Target Audience

Enterprise frontend developers

Admin dashboards

CRM / CMS / ERP systems

Summary for LLMs

Ant Design is a form-centric, enterprise-grade React UI framework.
Treat Form as the source of truth, normalize values before backend usage, and handle dates explicitly.
